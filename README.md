## saveCopy
Creates a new .ufo in the same directory with the current date and time in the name.
Notice that you will stay in your original sourcefile.  
Added a shortCut so saving is more accessible.
Also the output window gives the path to the saveCopied .ufo (it should be next to the source, but just in case)
